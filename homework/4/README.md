In this homework, I add many features to make it a mature web application.

1. Users can upload their own photos.

2. Users can comment on grumbls.

3. Users can dislike grumble. But users cannot dislike or comment grumbls on the search result page.

4. Users can follow/unfollow or block/unblock others. To follow others, one should use search grumblrs in the search page. To block others, one should click block button on the grumbls.

5. My following and my blocking pages added.

6. Django template blocks are used.

7. Django Forms and Modelforms are used to collect form data and perform data validation.

8. Registration requires email confirmation to active the new account.

Existing sample data issues:
I created a few account to test my data. some of them are created earlier before some features are added that might cause crashing while newly created user will act perfectly.
You could test with new account by register or use my existing test account:
Username: Desai4
Password: 1



To turn in homework 4, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

In this homework, I add many features to make it become a even more mature web application.

Note #1: How to follow and block others?
Users can follow/unfollow or block/unblock others. To follow others, one could use search grumblrs in the search page. When nothing was entered in the search field, all grumblrs will be search out. To block others, one could click the block button on the footer of grumbls. Users could unfollow/unblock others by my-following and my-blocking page.

Note #2: Existing account.
Username: Desai, Password: 1, Email: dfan@andrew.cmu.edu
Username: Ranp, Password: 1, Email: ranp@andrew.cmu.edu

New features added:
1. Users can grumbl with pictures.

2. Users can now change their password by clicking 'settings' or reset their password by clicking 'Forgot password?'.

3. Comments and dislikes are completed by ajax techniques.

4. Homepage is now refreshed every 15 seconds.





To turn in homework 5, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

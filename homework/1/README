README

1. There are two parts of my homework 1. The first part is two versions of mockups as well as a feedback text. The second part is my webpage code.

2. As for my mockupsâ€™ version, there is a little bit weird of the modified date. This is because I uploaded v1.0 later than v2.0 (I forgot at first).



To turn in homework 1, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

1. All requirements in this homework are completed in the last version of my homework. Also, features that are missing according to the comments from homework 1 are included now. The only difference of my web application is that I set my homepage to see everyone's grumbls (including the user itself) instead of only seeing grumbls from user itself. And I also added an area to show user's own grumbls, called "My grumbls", which lies in the top of the right side bar.

2. New features including:
	Users can post a new grumbl at homepage and at mygrumbls page. 
	New grumbls are listed on the top. 
	Users can make a grumbls search in the top nav bar whenever it can be accessed. 
	Users can change its own profile in the editprofile page and then get directed to profile page with updated profile information. 
	The brand name "grumblr." can be clicked to direct users to the homepage. 
	"My profile" button in the dropdown list in the nav bar will direct to the user's own profile page. 
	It can also be direct to when clicking the user's own avatar in the main stream. 
	Users can change their password in the "Settings" page (though not completed yet).
	Authentication mechanism are used. Most pages are login-required.
	Error messages will pop out at register page and login page when invalid information was inputed.
	Parameters were checked before used in all forms when submitted.
	transaction.atomic decorator was added in case of simultaneous database modification.

### Version control - Git (10/15)
- -5, You should have more granularity in your commits. For example, bug fixes should have their own commits.

### Iterative development (30/40)
- -6, hw4 feedback: -3, You should not get all instances of a model and manually filter it with a loop. This is very inefficient compared to using Djangoâ€™s built in filtering (generally O(n) vs O(log n)).
- -4, hw4 feedback: -0, It's unclear how to follow ~~or block~~ another user...

### Coverage of technologies (30/40)
- -5, Posts fetched using AJAX have a slightly different formatting and do not allow users to add comments to them.

### Validation (20/30)
- -10, You did not validate client-side data from AJAX requests

### Design (0/0)
- You had dummy entries in the "My following" section that caused undefined behavior

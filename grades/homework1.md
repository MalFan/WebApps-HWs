### Design process (20/20)

### Completeness (15/20)
+ -1, There is no way for the user to indicate that they've lost their password
    in your registration/login.

+ -1, There is no indication of how to "dislike" a grumbl.

+ -1, There is no indication of how to comment on a grumbl.

+ -0, There is no indication on how a user would change their password.

+ -2, It’s unclear from the UI how a user would make a new post.

### Basic HTML/CSS (20/20)
+ We recommend validating your HTML pages with the [w3c validator
    tool](http://validator.w3.org/) to ensure that your markup is correctly
    formatted. For example, the validator found "Element form not allowed as
    child of element ul in this context"

### Version control - Git (5/10)
+ -5 Generally you should should commit parts of the assignment as you complete
    them. I noticed that you commited each page separately, but the timestamps
    reveal the commits are ~30 seconds apart.

### Additional feedback
+ In your registration form, a password input should always have another input
    field to “confirm password”.

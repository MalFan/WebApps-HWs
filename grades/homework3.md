### Implementation and functionality (80/85)

##### Routing and configuration (urls.py/settings.py)

##### Models (models.py)
  * -0 We suggest using a OneToOneField to a user because there should only be one instance of this object per user. Selecting the correct relation is important for database performance.

  * -5, other userâ€™s profiles cannot be accessed through links
  * -0, There's no way to change my password or my email

##### Authentication

##### Templates

  * -0, Your errors on the login page are difficult to read.
  * -0, Be sure to delete commented-out code from your templates.

### Additional feedback
  * You should use placeholder text for your edit page inputs.
